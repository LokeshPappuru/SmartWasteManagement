**Smart Waste Management**

A waste classification system designed to identify and recycle waste into six categories: glass, metal, paper, plastic, cardboard, and trash. This project leverages deep learning and modern web development technologies to promote efficient waste management and sustainability.

**Features**
Image Classification: Upload an image of waste, and the system classifies it into one of six categories using a trained CNN model.
Recycling Awareness: Promotes proper recycling by providing accurate waste type classification.
Interactive Frontend: A user-friendly interface built with HTML and CSS.

**Technologies Used**


**Programming Languages**: Python, SQL, HTML, CSS

**Database**: MySQL

Machine Learning Algorithm: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
